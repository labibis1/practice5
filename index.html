        <p class="peraA">Ten days ago, Ukraine's second city was plunged into darkness by a massive, targeted Russian missile attack on the energy system - it was the biggest since the start of the full-scale war.

            As Kharkiv works to restore power, there has been a wave of additional strikes across the country targeting the energy supply.
            <br><br>
            Volodymyr Zelensky has condemned what he calls Russia's "missile terror".
            The Ukrainian president has also renewed his calls to his country's allies for more air defence systems as protection.

            The authorities in Odesa on the Black Sea in the south of the country say the energy system there was the latest to be hit overnight, with missiles and drones, causing partial blackouts.
